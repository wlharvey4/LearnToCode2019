** Introduction

   \index{about} Last year, I wrote a post that went viral which gave you step
   by step instructions on how to become a web developer from scratch and for
   free. A lot has changed since then, and since Iâ€™m a proponent of not wasting
   time, I wanted to share with you the updated article because there is a ton
   of changes for 2019! The focus is on efficiency: Learn the right topics that
   are in demand right now so you can get hired as soon as possible.
